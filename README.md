# FirstProject - Sorting Application

First Project @Sparta Global Training

By Ben Wong

## Introduction:

This is a simple integer array generator & sorting application. 

By inputting the minimum value, the maximum value, and the array length, you can generate a random integer array without duplicate numbers, then sort them with the chosen sorting method. 

You can also get the execution time for referencing the efficiency of each method.

## User Guideline:

1) You can launch the application using **_Main class_**

![alt-image](readmeSource/main.jpg)


2) After running the main method, you should see the below message appeared:


   ![alt-image](readmeSource/input1.jpg)
   
You can input how many sort methods you want in a single run.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Only integers are acceptable for any number input in this application

_If your input is invalid, you will be able to input again:_

_If your input is valid, you will see the INFO log as below:_

4) Then follow the instructions to input the ***Minimum value***, ***Maximum value***, and ***Array length***

**IMPORTANT**:

- ***Maximum value*** should larger than ***Minimum value***

- **_Array length_** shouldn't larger than (***Maximum value*** - ***Minimum value*** +1)

5) After inputting a valid array length, you should get a random sorted array.

_Example:_

minValue: 0

maxValue: 9

arrayLength: 10

6) Then you can input the sort method you want (bubble/merge/tree):

**IMPORTANT**:

According to the number of methods you have input at the beginning, 
you could select multiple sort methods in a single run.

_If your input is invalid, you will be able to input again:_

7) Finally, you can get the execution time, sort results, and the end message.

**IMPORTANT**: 

- Merge sort may have multiple execution time, the bottom one will be the final result.
